# onine_poker_game
An online poker game, made in PHP in my CIS195P class.  This project was to demonstrate a fairly comlex usage of integrating Javascript and PHP,
using GET to transfer data from one page to another, using many types of constants, and using logic to allow gameplay, such as
calculating hand values by combination of cards.
